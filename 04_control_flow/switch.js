// ------------------------how does javascript execute code + call stack----------------------------

/*

1.JS creates Global excution context 
2.Next it creates memory phase
3.Memory phase - In this phase,the variables are set to undefined 
  until the execution phase(next phase) and the functions are set to their definitions.
4.Next it creates the execution phase
5.Execution phase - In this phase,the variables are initialsed to given values and 
  when the function s are called,it creates a memory phase and execution phase for the function 
  just like the main one.




The working of the JavaScript works on three phases:
1. Global Execution Context
2. Memory phase / Creation phase
3. Execution phase

Phase 1: Global Execution Context
The value of `this` keyword is set to Global Execution Context (which is an empty Object in NODE environment, & window object in browser environment)

Phase 2: Memory phase
During this phase, JS engine scans the code and assigns the initial values for the variables , functions, etc.. For variables they are 'undefined' and for functions they are set to their function definition

Phase 3: Execution phase
After the creation phase completed, the execution phase begins where actual values of the variables are set. And when the functions are called it creates a new 'Function Execution' context which consists of two phases (they works same as explained above but only for the particular function scope):
1. Memory phase 
2. Execution phase 
The return value of the 'Function Execution' context is passed to the Global Execution Context
